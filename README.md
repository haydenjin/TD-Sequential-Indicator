# TD-Sequential-Indicator

Welcome to TD Sequential!

This indicator is build for tradingview and is split up into 3 files

Part 1 and Part 2 work together and are meant to be combined. I had to separate the 2 files as Tradingview allows for only 64 outputs, which is more than I needed.

The third file named "combined" is a combination of Part 1 and Part 2. Use this file if you only have room for 1 indicator as opposed to both. The consequence of shrinking this down to one file is that counts between 5 and 13 show up as red dots instead of actual integer values (for a 13 countdown).  

Also included is a quick guide on how to use the pine editor within tradingview.

Enjoy!
